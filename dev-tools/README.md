# Migrating from Flask and React to FastAPI and Vue using Windsurf

## Summary

Following instructions from a simple prompt, Windsurf analyzed the current setup and generated a plan for the entire migration.

### Backend Migration (Flask → FastAPI)

1. Upon user confirmation, Windsurf proceeded with the backend migration. First, it created the directory structure using terminal commands.
2. Then, it generated the code for 13 files, resulting in the following project initial structure (altered many times over the course of the migration):

    ```text
    backend-fastapi/
    ├── alembic/
    │   ├── versions/
    │   ├── env.py
    │   └── script.py.mako
    ├── app/
    │   ├── api/
    │   │   └── api_v1/
    │   │       ├── endpoints/
    │   │       │   └── words.py
    │   │       └── api.py
    │   ├── core/
    │   │   └── config.py
    │   ├── db/
    │   │   └── base.py
    │   ├── models/
    │   │   ├── word.py
    │   │   ├── group.py
    │   │   └── study.py
    │   └── schemas/
    │       └── word.py
    ├── tests/
    ├── alembic.ini
    └── requirements.txt
    ```

3. Created the virtual environment with `pyenv virtualenv` and Python 3.11.11 as the interpreter, and installed the backend dependencies. Note that this step was completed without Windsurf's help, which unsurprisingly recommended using the far more common, but in our case less desirable, `python -m venv venv` command.
4. Windsurf attempted to run the Alembic migrations, and self-corrected when encountering an error identifying a missing package. After a few interactions to troubleshoot interactively, Windsurf continued with the migration, eventually hitting another error that identified missing endpoints. Again, it self-corrected interactively, creating four new modules during the process.
5. Once it appeared all the issues had been resolved, and the migrations had run successfully, the server started successfully and the API was accessible.
6. Windsurf was then asked to verify that the migration had been completed successfully. Windsurf identified two missing endpoints. It generated new endpoints for them, creating two new files during the process, and updated the `api.py` file accordingly.
7. Windsurf was then asked to generate tests before proceeding with the frontend migration. Windsurf successfully generated the tests, self-correcting and debugging as needed multiple times. Eventually, it got all 25 tests to pass. In the process, it created configuration files, fixtures, and more.
8. Before moving on to the frontend migration, Windsurf was asked to configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Windsurf was able to successfully configure the pipeline, and it was able to run the pipeline successfully.

### Frontend Migration (React → Vue)

For the frontend migration, Windsurf was asked to adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach. Windsurf was able to successfully adopt TDD, gradually writing the tests, ensuring they failed, and then writing the code to make the tests pass.

### Overall Experience with Windsurf

Compared to using VS Code with GitHub Copilot, Windsurf's analysis and agentic capabilities proved very robust. Windsurf self-corrected errors, interacted with the user to troubleshoot, and generated all code.

Not a single line of code was written by the user; Windsurf generated all the code, including tests and CI/CD configuration. Windsurf was also leveraged to write the documentation for the project. Except for the autocomplete used while writing this README, all documentation was generated by Windsurf with minimal formatting and editing by the user.

**The results were impressive**.

## Initial Prompt

```text
The lang-portal directory contains the source code for a Flask backend and a React frontend. Let's rebuild this application using FastAPI and VueJS. How about we start by outlining the overall plan and inferring the project requirements from the current setup?
```

## Windsurf's Initial Analysis Outcome and Plan

### Backend Migration

- Current Features:
  - SQLite database integration
  - CORS configuration with dynamic origins
  - Routes for: words, groups, study sessions, dashboard, and study activities
  - Testing setup with pytest
- Migration Tasks:
  - Set up FastAPI project structure
  - Migrate SQLite database integration using SQLAlchemy
  - Convert Flask routes to FastAPI endpoints with type hints
  - Implement FastAPI CORS middleware
  - Set up pytest for FastAPI

### Frontend Migration

- Current Features:
  - TypeScript support
  - Vite as build tool
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - React Router for navigation
  - UI components using Radix UI
- Migration Tasks:
  - Set up Vue 3 project with Vite
  - Implement TypeScript support
  - Set up Vue Router (equivalent to React Router)
  - Migrate Tailwind CSS configuration
  - Replace Radix UI components with equivalent Vue components (possibly using Headless UI)

### Project Requirements

Backend Dependencies:

```text
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn>=0.27.0
sqlalchemy>=2.0.25
python-multipart>=0.0.9
pytest>=7.4.3
httpx>=0.26.0  # for testing
```

Frontend Dependencies:

```text
vue>=3.4.0
vue-router>=4.2.0
typescript>=5.5.3
tailwindcss>=3.4.13
@headlessui/vue>=1.7.0
vite>=5.4.1
```

### Migration Strategy

1. Start with a fresh project setup
2. Implement backend first:
    - Set up FastAPI with SQLAlchemy
    - Migrate routes one by one
    - Add tests for each endpoint
3. Then implement frontend:
    - Set up Vue project with TypeScript
    - Migrate routing structure
    - Implement components using Vue composition API
    - Style with Tailwind CSS

### Development Workflow

- Backend

  1. Development server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`
  2. Testing: `pytest`

- Frontend

  1. Development: `npm run dev`
  2. Build: `npm run build`
