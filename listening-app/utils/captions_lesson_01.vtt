00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:08.860
this is the first video in a twelve part series about toki pona, a minimalist language created

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:13.019
by jan Sonja, first published in the year 2001. in this series, I will be giving an

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:17.130
overview of how the language works, as described in the two official books.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.860
with a growing community of thousands of speakers, toki pona is one of the most popular constructed

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:24.930
languages out there, and in my opinion, that’s because learning toki pona is a lot of fun.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.730
it’s a language with less than two hundred words. in fact, there are fewer words in toki

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:32.669
pona’s core vocabulary than there are first generation pokémon. this restrictive vocabulary

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.620
means that when speaking toki pona, talking about any complex subject involves describing

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:40.559
what that thing is in simpler terms. as jan Sonja has said, “if English is a thick novel,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:45.010
then toki pona is a haiku”.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.719
the name “toki pona” means “good language”. the first word in the name is “toki”,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.670
which generally means “communicate” or “communication”.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:53.109
you can also use toki as an interjection. saying “toki!” on its own is a way of

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.899
announcing that communication is happening, as a way of starting a conversation. naturally,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.760
this is the most common way to say “hello” in toki pona.

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:03.379
all content words in toki pona have multiple functions like this. this is a very important

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.969
part of how the language is able to work with such a small vocabulary. as you learn more

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.810
words, you can start to develop more of an intuition for how these functions are related

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.850
to each other.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.850
it’s important to remember that these multiple functions are not the same thing as a word

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.469
having multiple meanings. all of these ideas encapsulated by toki fall under the large

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.830
umbrella of “communication”. it’s one single idea, but it corresponds to a large

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:26.009
number of different English words, because English words are categorically more specific

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.700
and precise than toki pona words.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:31.369
the second word is “pona”, which means “good”.

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.649
adjectives go after nouns in toki pona, which is the opposite to how they work in English,

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.570
so in a two-word noun phrase like “toki pona”, the first word functions as a noun,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.630
and the second functions as an adjective. so, “toki pona” means “good language”.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.520
you sometimes also see pona translated as “simple”. this is part of the philosophy

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.170
of toki pona. in this language, the way to describe any given concept isn’t a question

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.030
of knowing what “the word” for the concept is, like it is in most other languages. instead,

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:57.689
figuring out how to talk about something means figuring out what you believe that thing is,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.670
from your own subjective point of view.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.270
because of this, pona doesn’t just mean “good”, it means “good, in my own subjective

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:07.999
opinion”. describing something as pona is a way of saying it’s something you personally

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.780
like. so, if you don’t personally think simplicity is one of the concepts that falls

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:15.379
under the “pona” umbrella, then for you, it doesn’t.

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.069
but, since toki pona is a language where its simplicity is its main appeal, anyone who

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:21.879
speaks toki pona is pretty likely to personally subjectively enjoy things that are simple.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.920
so that’s why pona can be used to mean “simple”. the word “ike” can be used similarly.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.349
it can mean bad, evil, or wrong, in a moral, emotional, objective or subjective sense.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.790
this type of broad meaning isn’t particularly uncommon (all of this applies just as well

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:38.659
to the English word “bad”), but it’s part of the philosophy of the language that

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.870
applies similarly to pretty much every other word.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.150
sorry, right, I’m getting ahead of myself. let’s talk about phonology!

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:46.989
toki pona uses nine consonants and five vowels. due to the small phonemic inventory, each

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.110
phoneme has a wide range of acceptable pronunciations. for the most part, these consonants are pronounced

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.460
the way they are in English. the exception is the letter ⟨j⟩, which represents a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.860
palatal semivowel, /j/, like the English letter ⟨y⟩. so, this word, which means “person”,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.760
is pronounced like /jan/, with a /j/. this is the value the letter ⟨j⟩ has in the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.200
International Phonetic Alphabet, which is why toki pona uses it this way.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.560
the five vowels in toki pona are the standard five-vowel system: /i u e o a/.

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.159
this means vowels are pronounced the way they are in languages like Spanish, Japanese, or

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.290
Swahili. like consonants, there is room for variation with how they can be pronounced.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.159
and really that’s pretty much all you need to remember when you’re reading toki pona

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:27.829
text, at least for now. ⟨j⟩ is pronounced like English ⟨y⟩, and the vowels are the

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:30.549
standard five-vowel system. there’s like, two other things you’ll eventually need

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.910
to know, but they’re not relevant yet.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.540
oh, right, one other thing. toki pona only uses capital letters for names, and not at

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:38.969
the start of sentences. I generally avoid capitalizing the starts of sentences in English

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.030
for aesthetic purposes, but in toki pona that’s normal. the only time toki pona uses capital

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:47.079
letters is for proper names, as in “jan Sonja”, or “jan Misali”.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.200
that’s enough about that for now. I think it’s time to introduce one of the most fundamental

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.349
pieces of toki pona grammar: the particle “li”.

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.970
“li” is a very important word. you can basically think of it as a “verbifying”

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.840
particle. it marks that whatever comes after it is being used as a verb. so for example,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.040
we can make the sentence “jan li toki,” where li is marking that “toki” is a verb!

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.480
this sentence means something like “a person talks.”

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.939
however, this translation adds extra information that is not present in the original sentence.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.120
“jan” could be translated as “a person”, “people”, “the person”, “the people”,

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.710
“someone”, “humanity”, and so on. likewise, “li toki” could be translated

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.340
as “talks”, “talked”, “is talking”, “has talked”, et cetera.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:26.990
some would call the amount of ways a simple sentence like this can be translated into

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.100
English “ambiguous”, but I’d argue that it isn’t ambiguous: it’s vague. it’s

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.060
not that it could mean any of these individual sentences, and there’s no way to figure

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.010
out which one it’s supposed to mean; it’s that the one thing this sentence means is

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.540
broader than any possible English translation you could give.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.480
like, the English sentence “she hit the man with an umbrella” is ambiguous, because

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.100
it could either mean that she used an umbrella to hit the man, or that the man she hit is

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.300
the one who has an umbrella. it could mean either of those things separately, and it’s

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.940
unclear which one it is without additional context.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.110
however, it’s also unclear what color the umbrella is, or what her age is relative to

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.080
the man she hit, or what time of day it was when this happened, or how many people saw

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.720
it, and an infinite number of other possible factors. I’d say that this is not ambiguous,

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.480
it’s just information that isn’t specified. it’s not ambiguous, it’s just fuzzy.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.300
anyway, toki pona doesn’t have the verb “to be.” to express the idea that something

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.190
is something else, you just put it into that verb spot marked with li. for example, to

00:05:21.581 --> 00:05:21.581
say “a person is good”, you would say “jan li pona”. don’t forget to include

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.600
“li”! without li, “jan pona” on its own just means “a good person”. it’s

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.270
a noun phrase rather than a complete sentence.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.210
side note, because pona means “good, in the sense that I personally like it”, “jan

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.700
pona” can be more accurately translated as “someone I like”. so, jan pona is the

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.520
most common way to say “friend” in toki pona.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.490
another example, “toki pona” means “a good language”, but “toki li pona” is

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.110
a full sentence meaning “a language is good”, or possibly “communication is good”. but

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:48.270
remember, “li” isn’t the verb here. li is verbing the word that comes after it.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.580
translated literally, “jan li pona” means something closer to “a person goods” or

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:56.530
“a person is gooding”. but in general, “X li Y” is the way to say “X is Y”

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.490
in toki pona. this means that a sentence like “jan li

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.310
moku” could mean either “a person eats” or “a person is food”. there are ways

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.410
to work around this, but for the most part this is something that can be inferred by

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.400
context.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.400
now that we know how verbs work, let’s look at some other examples!

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:14.690
lape means sleep, or rest. this is actually cognate with the English word “sleep”,

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:17.980
fun fact. and olin means love! as you can probably pick

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.610
up by now, this is a broad sense of love that includes all the various meanings that the

00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.051
English word has.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:25.051
now that we have some more verbs, let’s move on to pronouns. toki pona has only one

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.470
third person pronoun, “ona”. unlike English third person pronouns, the

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.550
word “ona” does not imply any information about gender, number, or animacy. it’s the

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:35.380
single all-purpose third person pronoun used for all your third person pronoun needs.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.860
of course, you can specify information about number and gender if you want, which will

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.020
be covered in future videos, it’s just that that information isn’t baked into the pronoun

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.700
itself.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.700
you can use ona as a noun, as in “ona li olin”, or as an adjective, where it works

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.060
like an English possessive pronoun, as in “moku ona li pona”.

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:52.990
the first and second person pronouns work very similarly. the first person pronoun is

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:56.990
“mi”. once again, this does not contain any grammatical

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.280
number information, so it could be either singular or plural. and again, this can be

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.650
used as an adjective, where it has the same function as an English possessive pronoun.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.190
and then the second person pronoun is “sina”. there is an edge case in the grammatical rules

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:09.920
of toki pona for these two words. if the subject of a sentence is either just “mi” or just

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.290
“sina”, then the particle “li” is not used. so, rather than say “*sina li

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.450
pona” for “you are good”, you just say “sina pona”. similarly, to say “I am

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:22.590
a person”, that’s “mi jan”, not “*mi li jan”.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.250
this exception only applies if the subject is just “mi” or “sina”. if the subject

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:29.290
is something like “moku sina”, “your food”, or “jan pona mi”, “my friend”,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.000
you still need to use “li”.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.160
and you know what, I think that’s enough grammatical concepts for now. there’s a

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.660
good amount more ground to cover, but that can wait for future videos.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.600
so alright, let’s practice! first, I’ll give a few sentences for you to translate

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:42.620
into English.

00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:43.620
let’s start with a basic one. what does “olin li pona” mean?

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.160
[pause]

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.160
yes, that’s exactly correct, “love is good”. don’t worry if you didn’t remember

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.280
what “olin” means, you’ll get the hang of it soon enough with some practice.

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:55.870
now, what do you think “ona li lape” means? [pause]

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:01.600
right! this sentence could mean “they sleep,” “she is sleeping,” “he slept,” or

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:06.060
any variation of that idea. remember, ona does not specify number or gender, and verbs

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.500
don’t mark tense! we’ll learn more about specifying time with verbs in a later lesson.

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:14.250
okay, what about “moku mi li ike”? [pause]

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:19.450
that’s right, this sentence translates to “my food is bad.” remember, you can use

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:23.740
pronouns like mi as adjectives too!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:25.560
okay, now it’s your turn. how would you say “you love”?

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:30.740
[pause]

00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:32.330
did you say “sina olin”? if so, good job! if you said “*sina li olin”, remember,

00:08:36.569 --> 00:08:36.569
you don’t use li after mi or sina as subjects. as we saw in the last example, this doesn’t

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:40.789
apply when they’re adjectives like in “moku mi,” since they aren’t the subjects themselves.

00:08:44.529 --> 00:08:44.529
okay, let’s try a more complicated one. how would you say “I am your friend”?

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:48.519
[pause]

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:49.519
need a hint? remember, in toki pona, a “friend” is a “good person”!

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:55.920
[pause]

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:56.920
exactly, it’s “mi jan pona sina”! congratulations! just look at how much you’ve learned in

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.060
such a short time! with toki pona, as long as you can grasp a few basic concepts, you

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:06.710
have the tools to express an extremely wide range of ideas.

00:09:09.139 --> 00:09:09.139
well, that’s all for today’s lesson. I’ll try to put out at least one of these toki

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:12.579
pona lessons a month until this series is over, alternating between these and my other

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.150
videos. there’s a lot of fun things to cover in the rest of the series, so needless to

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:19.620
say, I’m a bit excited. mi tawa!
