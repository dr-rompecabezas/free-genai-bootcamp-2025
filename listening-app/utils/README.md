This utility provides functionality to download YouTube video transcripts and convert them into VTT (Web Video Text Tracks) format, which can be used for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

## Features

- Extract video ID from YouTube URLs
- Download auto-generated subtitles
- Convert transcripts to VTT format
- Support for further processing with Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from youtube_transcript import download_vtt

# Download transcript for a YouTube video
youtube_url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR_VIDEO_ID"
download_vtt(youtube_url, output_file="captions.vtt")
```

### Output Format

The utility generates a VTT file with the following structure:

```text
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
First caption text

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Second caption text
```

## Applications with LLMs

The generated VTT file can be used for various NLP tasks:

1. **Video Summarization**
   - Feed the transcript to an LLM to generate concise summaries
   - Extract key points and main topics from the video

2. **Language Learning**
   - Extract sentences for language study
   - Generate translations for learning content
   - Create vocabulary lists and example sentences

3. **Content Analysis**
   - Extract topics and themes
   - Create study materials

## Integration with Streamlit App

- Provide synchronized subtitles
- Generate interactive learning materials
- Create quizzes and exercises based on video content
- Offer translations and explanations of difficult phrases
