# GenAI Bootcamp 2025: Toki Pona AI-Enhanced Language Learning Experiments

This repository contains assignments completed during ExamPro's free GenAI Bootcamp. Be aware that **this code is not meant for production use**. The git tags only serve as a record of progress through the bootcamp. Similarly, GitHub issues have been used to help instructors quickly reference the commits related to a particular assignment.

## ðŸŽ§ `/listening-app` directory

The `listening-app` directory contains a Streamlit-based application featuring:

- Interactive translation practice with AI-powered feedback
- Text-to-speech capabilities using OpenAI's TTS API
- GPT prompt construction for context-dependent translations
- Utility tool for processing YouTube transcripts to support NLP tasks

The application demonstrates practical use of Large Language Models (GPT) and Text-to-Speech technology in language education.

## ðŸª¢ `/lang-portal` directory

### Final FastAPI Build (Pending Frontend Rebuild)

This directory contains the source code for the language learning platform. It has been rebuilt twice. The current backend is a FastAPI application with 100% test coverage for the endpoints, CRUD operations, Pydantic models, and SQLAlchemy models.

The frontend was removed as it is being rebuilt. See Issue #3 for details.

To see the older builds, check out the `flask-react-final` and `fastapi-vue-final` tags (see details below).

### Original Codebase in Flask and React

The `lang-portal` directory originally contained a Flask backend and a React frontend, copied over as-is, from the instructor's repository.

The last commit before switching to FastAPI and Vue is tagged as `flask-react-final`.

```sh
git checkout flask-react-final
```

### First Migration Attempt to FastAPI and Vue

The codebase was then migrated to FastAPI and Vue, using the Windsurf code editor, as part of a learning exercise to test the capabilities of the new generation of AI-powered code editors. The last commit after completing the migration is tagged as `fastapi-vue-final`.

```sh
git checkout fastapi-vue-final
```

This migration experience was documented in the `/dev-tools` directory.

## ðŸ§­ `/genai-architecting` directory

The `/genai-architecting` directory contains solution architecting assignments. It is meant to serve as a reference for the architecture of the GenAI-powered language learning platform that is being built.

## ðŸ”­ `/sentence-constructor` directory

The `/sentence-constructor` directory contains a report on the exploration of specific large language models' baseline capabilities to act as language tutors using simple prompts and feedback.

## ðŸ§ª `/dev-tools` directory

The `/dev-tools` directory contains detailed notes on the use of Windsurf to migrate the application from Flask and React to FastAPI and Vue.
