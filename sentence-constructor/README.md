# Japanese Sentence Constructor

This file contains the original assignment up to and including the technical restrictions as well as the adapted generalized learning objectives for the assignment. The original assignment is about building a chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance. The assignment requires the use of an AI-Powered Assistant of the developer's choice. The adapted learning objectives are intended to guide the experimentation with pre-trained AI models in languages other than Japanese, i.e., French, Spanish, and English. This adaptation to the assignment is intended to provide a more generalizable learning experience because evaluating the effectiveness of AI-Powered Assistants in language learning requires expertise in the language being taught.

## Difficulty

Level 100

## Business Goal

A chat agent that acts as a teaching assistant to guide students from translating a target English sentence into Japanese. The teaching assistant is not there to provide the direct answer, only guidance.

**Will AI-Powered Assistants replace real teachers?**

## Technical Uncertainty

- How well can an AI-Powered Assistant perform a very broad task?
- Would a very broad task be better performed by dividing it into subtasks with specialized agents?
- Does using an AI-Powered Assistant make for a good place to rapidly prototype agents?
- How could we take the agent we built in an AI-Powered Assistant and reimplement it into a stack that allows for direct integration into our platform?
- How much do we have to rework our prompt documents from one AI-Powered Assistant to another?
- What prompting techniques can we naturally discover working in the confines of an AI-Powered Assistant?
- Are there any interesting innovations unique to specific AI-Powered Assistants for our business goal?
- What were we able to achieve based on our AI-Powered Assistant choice and our hardware, or budget limitations?

## Technical Restrictions

An AI-Powered Assistant of the developer’s choice must be used, e.g.:

- Meta AI <https://www.meta.ai/>
- ChatGPT <https://openai.com/index/chatgpt/>
- Anthropic Claude <https://www.anthropic.com/claude>
- Mistral AI <https://mistral.ai/>
- *Ollama + Open WebUI <https://openwebui.com/>
- *LibreChat <https://www.librechat.ai/>
- Leon <https://github.com/leon-ai/leon>

## Adapted Learning Ojectives

The folllowing learning objectives are inferred from the business goal and technical uncertainty. They were generated using ChatGPT and the original assignment as a reference.

### AI-Driven Tutoring and Pedagogical Learning Objectives

- Understand AI-assisted language learning: Examine how AI-powered assistants can guide learners without providing direct answers.
- Evaluate AI’s effectiveness in guided tutoring: Analyze whether AI agents can be effective teaching assistants.
- Compare human vs. AI tutoring strategies: Explore differences in how AI vs. human instructors provide feedback and guidance.
- Develop prompting techniques for AI tutors: Learn how to craft effective prompts to refine AI-generated guidance.
- Experiment with AI-assisted language learning methodologies: Explore different techniques AI can use to scaffold language learning.

### Technical Exploration Objectives (AI-Powered Assistants)

- Assess AI-powered assistants’ ability to handle broad tasks: Determine how well an AI can perform a complex and open-ended teaching role.
- Investigate task decomposition in AI tutoring: Evaluate whether breaking down broad learning tasks into smaller AI-driven subtasks improves learning outcomes.
- Explore AI prototyping for language education: Experiment using AI-powered assistants as rapid prototyping tools for language-learning applications.
- Examine AI portability and integration: Identify how an AI model trained in one assistant can be re-implemented into a platform-integrated AI stack.
- Compare AI-powered assistant performance: Assess differences in AI behaviour across various platforms, considering cost, hardware, and software constraints.
- Understand AI platform-specific innovations: Identify unique features of different AI-powered assistants that could enhance language learning.
- Analyze the impact of prompt reusability: Determine how much AI prompts need to be adjusted when switching between AI-powered assistants.
