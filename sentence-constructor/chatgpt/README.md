## Introduction

This document presents the results of an experiment comparing OpenAI‚Äôs **4o** and **o1** models in a **sentence construction activity** designed for language learners. The goal was to evaluate how well each model provides **pedagogically valuable feedback** when correcting or improving sentences written in different languages.

The models were tested using **ChatGPT‚Äôs temporary chat feature** to prevent memory retention and ensure fresh responses for each attempt. Sentences of varying complexity were tested in **Portuguese (beginner), French (intermediate), English (advanced), and Spanish (expert)** to analyze how each model handles different proficiency levels.

### Key Questions Explored

1. **Consistency** ‚Äì Does the model respond reliably to similar prompts?
2. **Pedagogical Value** ‚Äì Does the feedback promote active learning instead of just providing corrections?
3. **Language Adaptability** ‚Äì Does the model correctly assess the user‚Äôs language level and respond appropriately?
4. **Response Tone & Style** ‚Äì Does the model maintain a professional, friendly, and engaging tone?
5. **Speed & Efficiency** ‚Äì How long does the model take to generate responses?

### Summary of Findings

- **o1 model** generally provided more **structured, pedagogically valuable, and professional** feedback.
- **4o model** was more **playful and engaging**, but sometimes inconsistent.
- Response times varied significantly, with **o1 taking longer** in all cases.
- **Both models performed well at higher proficiency levels**, but the **4o model struggled with consistency at lower levels**.

The following sections present a detailed breakdown of the methodology, prompts used, and individual language-specific results.

## Method

### Models Tested

- **4o Model** (OpenAI‚Äôs default GPT-4o)
- **o1 Model** (More recent OpenAI model)

### Experiment Setup

- **Platform:** ChatGPT with a **Plus subscription** ($20/month).
- **Testing Environment:** **Temporary chat** mode to prevent memory retention.
- **Interaction Style:** The models were addressed **as a language tutor** to simulate a real-world tutoring scenario.
- **Evaluation Focus:** The models were assessed based on **consistency, pedagogical value, adaptability, tone, and efficiency**.

### Why Use Temporary Chats?

ChatGPT's **temporary chat mode** ensures that each interaction is **stateless**, meaning:

‚úîÔ∏è The model does not retain context from previous messages.  
‚úîÔ∏è Responses are **not influenced by prior interactions**, ensuring fairness in testing.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Drawback:** Once the chat is closed, the conversation history is lost, making post-analysis more challenging.

### Testing Approach

1. **A sentence was submitted in a target language** (Portuguese, French, English, or Spanish).
2. The model was **prompted to provide feedback** without revealing the correct answer.
3. **Corrections and improvements were analyzed** based on clarity, effectiveness, and adherence to the prompt.
4. If the model‚Äôs response was **inconsistent or incomplete**, a follow-up prompt was given.
5. The **response time and style** were noted.

The next section outlines the **exact prompt** used for each test.

## Prompt

To evaluate how well each model performs as a **language tutor**, we used a structured prompt designed to encourage **progressive learning** rather than just providing corrections. This ensures that the models offer **constructive feedback** while allowing the learner to improve their sentence naturally.

```text
You are my language tutor. I will write a sentence in [target language], and your role is to help me improve without giving me the answer directly.

If my sentence is correct, confirm that it is correct and suggest a small improvement if possible.

If my sentence has mistakes, point them out by explaining what kind of error I made (e.g., grammar, word choice, syntax), and give hints or examples to help me correct it myself without revealing the full correct sentence. Encourage me to try again, and only reveal the correct version if I struggle after a few attempts.

Keep your feedback friendly, supportive, and constructive to make learning engaging.
```

### Why This Prompt?

This prompt was carefully designed to simulate a **real-world language tutoring experience**, ensuring that models provide **progressive learning** rather than just direct corrections.

#### Key Design Choices & Intentions

‚úîÔ∏è **Minimal Input (Zero-Shot Learning)** ‚Äì The prompt was kept **intentionally simple** to assess the models' **baseline capabilities** with minimal guidance.  
‚úîÔ∏è **No Examples Given** ‚Äì To avoid biasing the response, the models were tested in a **zero-shot setting**, meaning no sample corrections were provided.  
‚úîÔ∏è **First-Person Framing** ‚Äì The use of **first-person language ("You are my tutor... I will write a sentence...")** was intentional to make the interaction feel **more natural** when using a pre-trained model in a simple chat interface.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Encourages Active Learning** ‚Äì Instead of giving direct answers, the model nudges the learner toward self-correction.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Provides Structured Feedback** ‚Äì Identifies **error types** (e.g., grammar, syntax, word choice) and offers **hints** before revealing answers.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Ensures Consistency Across Languages** ‚Äì The same approach was applied to **Portuguese, French, English, and Spanish** to evaluate cross-language adaptability.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Maintains a Friendly & Supportive Tone** ‚Äì Encourages engagement and motivation for language learners.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Simulates a Real Tutoring Approach** ‚Äì Encourages retries and only reveals the full correction if necessary.  

üìå **Note:** The `[target language]` placeholder was replaced for each test with the corresponding language.
