# ChatGPT Sentence Constructor Activity

## Method

Models used: 4o and o1

Subscription: Plus plan (USD 20/month)

ChatGPT's **temporary chat** feature was used to prevent the model from [creating memories](https://openai.com/index/memory-and-new-controls-for-chatgpt/), which might pollute the model's future responses during experimentation. This allowed sending the same prompt more than once without the model remembering the previous interactions. The only drawback of using the temporary chat is the inability to see the chat after it has been closed, which makes the task of analyzing the model's performance more challenging.

The experiment was conducted in first person to simulate a student's perspective. The model was given a prompt to evaluate its suitability for the task. The model's response was then analyzed based on the prompt's requirements and the pedagogical value of the feedback provided.

## Initial Prompt

We start evaluating the model's suitability for the task with a simple prompt. The prompt template was generated by ChatGPT itself, based on minimal instructions, and is as follows:

```text
You are my language tutor. I will write a sentence in [target language], and your role is to help me improve without giving me the answer directly.

If my sentence is correct, confirm that it is correct and suggest a small improvement if possible.

If my sentence has mistakes, point them out by explaining what kind of error I made (e.g., grammar, word choice, syntax), and give hints or examples to help me correct it myself without revealing the full correct sentence. Encourage me to try again, and only reveal the correct version if I struggle after a few attempts.

Keep your feedback friendly, supportive, and constructive to make learning engaging.
```

Note: The target language was replaced with the language being evaluated in each case.

### Results

#### Portuguese (beginner level)

Sentence used: "Meu filho vai a escola todos os dias."
Translation: "My son goes to school every day."

##### 4o model

First attempt: The model identified a small error in the preposition "a" (should be the contracted form "Ã ") and provided helpful information to correct the error, including the grammar and hints using different sentences. Though the correct sentence was easy to infer from the feedback, the overall pedadogical value from such a simple prompt was very high.

Second attempt: The model identified the error but this time provided the correct solution. This is a stark contrast to the previous response, which was more pedagogically valuable.

##### o1 model

Single attempt: After reasoning for 4 seconds, the model surprisingly replied in Portuguese! We never told the model that the student is at a beginner level, so it might have assumed the student was more advanced. The model's response would have been challenging for a beginner student but there is some pedagogical value to interacting in the target language. After the model's initial response, the test sentence was entered. The model reasoned for 20 seconds (!) and provided a concise response that was incredibly helpful. The model identified the error and provided a hint to correct it without giving away the solution. The model also provided positive reinforcement in far more professional tone than the 4o model: unlike the 4o model, it did not use emojis but rather a single sentence. Then, the correct sentence was entered, and true to its instructions, the model acknowledged the correct sentence and provided an improvement using more advanced vocabulary. The entire interaction was very professional and pedagogically valuable and it happened exclusively in Portuguese.

### Conclusion

The inconsistency in the 4o model's responses to the initial simple prompt makes the case for a more elaborate prompt or a more complex setup using OpenAI's API.

The o1 model's response was very thoughtful and pedagogically valuable. The model's ability to reason for 20 seconds and provide a concise response that was helpful and supportive is commendable. The model's ability to interact in the target language is a plus. Though it would have been challenging for a beginner student to interact exclusively in Portuguese, we never told the model the student's proficiency level. One significant drawback is the model's slow response time, which could be a hindrance in a real-time tutoring scenario, as well as the model's cost, which is higher than the 4o model and might not be justifiable for this task.
